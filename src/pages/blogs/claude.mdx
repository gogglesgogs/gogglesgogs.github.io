Sounds tricky, right? Well, Claude 3.5 has got it down to an art!

Imagine this: you ask Claude to write a sonnet about autumn, and within moments, it crafts a beautiful piece that captures the essence of falling leaves and the crisp air. It's like having a poetic friend who can whip up a masterpiece at a moment's notice.
