So, I just wrapped up building my new portfolio and I'm honestly so excited to share it with you all. I've always wanted a portfolio that would showcase my skills, and now I finally have something I can be proud of.

Here's the deal: I wanted my portfolio to be modern, fast, and visually clean, so I ended up using a bunch of cool tools and frameworks to bring it all together. Here's a rundown of everything I used:

## TailwindCSS for Styling

Okay, so I love Tailwind! If you haven't heard of it yet, it's a utility-first CSS framework that lets you design websites by adding classes directly to your HTML (or JSX/TSX, in my case). It's a game changer because:

- No more writing crazy custom CSS.
- You can build responsive layouts super easily.
- The design looks pretty clean and consistent from the start!

I didn't want to spend hours tweaking styles, so Tailwind made it so much easier to just focus on the content and layout. The best part is how fast it makes thingsâ€”just throw in some classes, and you're done.

## React for the Interactive Stuff

I've been learning React for a while now, and it just felt like the right tool for the job. I love how React lets me build reusable components. So for my portfolio, I ended up making many components for each of my sections and many more nested inside those components.

React is pretty fun to use, and I like that I could build parts of my site that could update without refreshing the whole page. Plus, it's easy to manage all the state, like showing modals or keeping track of which project I'm highlighting.

## Vite for Fast Builds

If you haven't used Vite yet, you need to check it out! Vite is a next-gen bundler that's super fast, and it makes React development feel like a breeze. The build times are insanely fast, which makes me not dread hitting "refresh" when I'm testing my site.

Also, Vite has hot module replacement (HMR), which means it instantly updates your changes without refreshing the whole page. So when I was tweaking my portfolio and testing everything, Vite kept things running smoothly. It's definitely a game-changer compared to other bundlers I've used before.

## How It All Comes Together

So, let's recap:

1. **Vite** gives me a fast, easy-to-set-up development environment.
2. **React** powers the dynamic, interactive parts of the site (like the project section and the contact form).
3. **Tailwind** makes styling a breeze, so I can focus on what matters: the content.

All of this combined created a super smooth workflow that made building my portfolio feel like a fun challenge instead of a stressful one. Plus, now I have a portfolio that I can show off!

## Lessons I Learned

- **Build it step by step**: Don't try to do everything at once. I started with a basic layout and then slowly added interactivity and special features.
- **Learn the tools**: I've been using Tailwind and React for a while, but TypeScript was a new challenge. At first, it was tricky, but now I feel like it was totally worth it.
- **Stay consistent**: Having a clean design is great, but consistency is key. Tailwind helped me keep everything in check, so my portfolio doesn't feel like it's all over the place.
